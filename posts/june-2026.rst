Games
=====

A wide supply of 18xx games are commonly available, brought by
attendees and local 18xx players' collections.  If there's something
you particularly want to play, just ask and we can probably ensure it
is there.  Several 18xx designers commonly also bring their prototypes
to play and discuss.
